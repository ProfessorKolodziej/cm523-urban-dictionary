## Get started by syncing with Glitch!

First time? Need some extra help getting set up? Check out [this tutorial video on Kaltura](https://mymedia.bu.edu/media/Put+it+All+TogetherA+Blackboard%2C+Github%2C+Glitch/1_66r1kz2n).

Just need a quick refresher? [Try this part of the video instead.](https://mymedia.bu.edu/media/Put+it+All+TogetherA+Blackboard%2C+Github%2C+Glitch/1_66r1kz2n?st=783)

**Import this repository to your Glitch account**
- Copy the URL of this repository, then open [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) in a new tab.
- Click "New Project", then "Import from Github".
- Paste the URL of this repository into the dialog.

A new Glitch project with this code will appear. Now, you should set up the export so that when you're done editing in Glitch, Github will be able to see your changes, and you can check to see if you met the assignment requirements. This is the perfect time to test that connection.

**Export your changes from Glitch to Gibhub**
- Click "Tools" at the bottom of the page, and then click "Import and Export".
- Click "Export to Github".
- Return to this tab and grab your repository name. For example, `ProfessorKolodziej/example-assignment`.
- You're ready to work! When you're happy with what you have, export your changes, and then return to Github and [create a pull request](https://mymedia.bu.edu/media/Put+it+All+TogetherA+Blackboard%2C+Github%2C+Glitch/1_66r1kz2n?st=640) from the new branch Glitch creates. Your grading and feedback will happen here!
- Don't forget to [submit your pull request to Blackboard](https://mymedia.bu.edu/media/Put+it+All+TogetherA+Blackboard%2C+Github%2C+Glitch/1_66r1kz2n?st=825) when you're ready for my feedback.

## How grading and feedback works

This repository uses Autograding to check the basic assignment requirements. Once you pass these requirements, [send me a link to the pull request in Blackboard](https://mymedia.bu.edu/media/Put+it+All+TogetherA+Blackboard%2C+Github%2C+Glitch/1_66r1kz2n?st=825). I'll give you additional feedback on things like performance and coding style, so you know how to improve your code for next time.

[Learn more about Autograding in this video](https://mymedia.bu.edu/media/Put+it+All+TogetherA+Blackboard%2C+Github%2C+Glitch/1_66r1kz2n?st=676)
